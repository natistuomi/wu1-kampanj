                        Our society is built by systems, laws and bureaucratic processes. 
                        We will probably never experience every single one of them on a personal 
                        level, but the job market is a maze we all have to navigate sometime in our 
                        lives and it is rarely an easy endeavor. Sweden may be well off regarding 
                        equality, but there are still clear signs that our job market is unbalanced. 
                        Our society will need to adjust to create an equal job market.

                    <h3 class="mobile_heading" id="lön">Wage gap</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wage differences is probably the first thought that comes to mind by the 
                        question at hand, but the wage gap in Sweden is steadily disappearing and 
                        has been doing so for 15 years. In the annual report <a href="https://www.mi.se/other-languages/about-the-mediation-office-the-swedish-model-and-wage-statistics-in-english/">
                        "Wage gap between women and men 2020"</a> (p. 13 - 14, 02.02.2021) by the 
                        Swedish National Mediation Office, the estimated wage gap was under 10%. In 
                        reality that number is lower because of the considerable differences between 
                        genders regarding our work life. More women work part time and it is usually 
                        women who take time off to care for children or other family members. The 
                        biological difference creates different circumstances when we have kids. It is 
                        also difficult to compare our wages when they are individually based on our own 
                        merits and efforts. To top it all off, women have a habit of working low paid 
                        jobs while staying out of the high paying industries. Our choice of profession 
                        is a large factor to the wage gap in Sweden. The goal is for everyone to have 
                        equal conditions when it comes to getting paid. We have come a long way, but 
                        there is still room for improvement.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mobile_heading" id="fördelning">Gender distribution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gender distribution on the job market can contribute to a diverse workforce. 
                        Diversity benefits everyone, but it is also positive from a solely working perspective. 
                        Different people work differently. Personal strengths and ideas originate from our own 
                        experience and that makes diversity valuable. It is also an easier endeavor to find 
                        appropriate competence when hiring if you consider a larger group of people. 
                        Unfortunately, today’s market is mostly split between male and female dominated areas 
                        of expertise. Statistics Sweden’s publication <a href="https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/living-conditions/gender-statistics/gender-statistics/pong/publications/women-and-men-in-sweden2.-facts-and-figures-2020/">
                        “Speaking of women and men 2020”</a> (p. 66 - 67, 17.06.20) mentions that only four of 
                        the 30 largest professions in Sweden have an equal division between genders. Statistics 
                        show that women usually work with children or health care while men have a strong leaning 
                        towards technology and vehicle-related professions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At this point, have we not all tired of the neverending nagging about equality? 
                        It is hardly difficult to understand. We constantly discuss statistics, rights 
                        and injustices. It does give an overview of the situation and equal wages should 
                        not be a question, but the point is not to have wonderful numbers to proudly 
                        present. At its core, equality is not about society. It is about the individual. 
                        Of course, it is advantageous to have an equal gender distribution, but in the end 
                        it will not necessarily be a sin if that is not the case. It all comes down to one 
                        question. Why do we split the job market between us? Is it to avoid a negative 
                        atmosphere at our workplace? Is it because we are afraid of what other people will 
                        think? Are we simply not brave enough to stand out from the crowd? We deserve to 
                        pick our work, or even education, based on personal interest instead of unfair 
                        expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a lot that can contribute to an equal job market. The most important step 
                        is changing our attitudes. Our job market will need some practical adjustments, 
                        but we need to eradicate the limits we needlessly set on ourselves and those around 
                        us. Limits that fill no purpose other than to determine what we can or can not do. 
                        It is high time to open our eyes, see the problem and act accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The job market is unbalanced.
